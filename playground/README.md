# Playground

This directory contains various demo projects. Each subdirectory is a separate project with its own setup and requirements.

## Available Projects

- **remote-class**: simple metaprogramming demo where method calls are replaced with mock rpc calls

## General Setup

Projects in this directory use Python virtual environments. To set up a project:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if available)
5. Follow any additional instructions in the project's README.md

Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done: `deactivate`
